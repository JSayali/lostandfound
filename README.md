Take a look at it - [Lost & Found](http://csuf-lostandfound.herokuapp.com/)

### Description
'Lost & Found' is a single page web application with real-time features which provides users with a platform to report anything lost or found around the 'Cal State Fullerton (CSUF)' campus. It allows user to post information about the stuff he/she lost or found around the campus by selecting the campus location directly from the campus map. User can see posts posted by other users and can also contact the other users to claim the lost item or return the item found by him. Chat feature has been provided to facilitate such real-time user interaction. Once the lost item has been found by its owner or the found item has been returned to its owner, the user can also delete the respective post to stop chat request for that item.
The application is in initial development stage and further improvements and feature additions are in progress.
